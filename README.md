# Express Banking System

## Description

This project is an Express-based banking system designed to streamline and optimize banking operations. It provides a secure and user-friendly interface for managing bank accounts, facilitating money transfers, and simplifying the account creation process. The system allows customers to create accounts, check balances, and perform transactions, while also providing banking professionals with tools to manage accounts and transactions efficiently.

The project integrates JavaScript, data structures, and basic algorithms to deliver a robust and scalable solution for modern banking needs.

## Features

1. **Account Creation**: 
   - Customers can create new bank accounts by providing their name, email, and initial deposit amount.
   - Each account is assigned a unique account ID.

2. **Balance Inquiry**: 
   - Customers can check their account balance by providing their account ID.

3. **Money Transfer**: 
   - Customers can transfer money between accounts.
   - The system ensures that the transfer is valid (e.g., sufficient balance, valid account IDs).

4. **Transaction History**: 
   - Customers can view their transaction history, including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

5. **Error Handling**: 
   - The system validates input data and provides appropriate error messages for invalid requests.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: A high-level, interpreted programming language used for building the application logic.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to build the RESTful API.
- **Body-Parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in JSON format.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays and objects are used to store and manage accounts and transactions.
- **Basic Algorithms**: Simple algorithms are implemented for account ID generation, balance checks, and money transfers.
